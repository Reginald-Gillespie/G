# Goose Trollware
Goose program prank install wrapper for digispark. Keeping the link short for speed of exploit. 

See here for the original program https://desktop-goose.en.uptodown.com/windows

My code is intended to allow a digispart to plugin, quickly type the initial payload, and unplug while the code sets up the rest in the background.

The intent is to create a startup wrapper, placing it in the shell:startup folder. 

---

i.ps1: The install script run by the digispark

run.vbs: The vbs script copied to the autostartup folder.
